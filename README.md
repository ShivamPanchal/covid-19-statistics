## Introduction
A web app uses react, material ui and echarts to represent statistics of coronavirus in the world.
- New Hosting on AWS S3: http://covid-19-statistics.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/
- Original Hosting on heroku: http://covid-19-statistics.herokuapp.com/

Note: 
- The new hosting on AWS S3 is auto-deployed(updating epidemic data) by github Actions workflow script;
- If you cannot access heroku site for the first time, that's because it's sleeping when it's idle. So try a second visit after 2-3 minutes as it will be awaken once you've started first access.
