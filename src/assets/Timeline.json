Officials said that the individual, a woman in her 20s and a student at University of Western Ontario, returned from Wuhan on January 23. She was asymptomatic and had tested negative at first, but additional advanced testing confirmed that the woman had low levels of the virus in her system. Officials said that the individual wore a mask during her voyage and she voluntarily entered self-isolation upon her return, making a full recovery after two or three days. On the same day, the Government of Ontario reported that 17 cases were under investigation within its provincial jurisdiction. Officials said that most of the individuals under investigation were awaiting results while in self-isolation at home. As of January 30, the associate medical officer of Ontario said that the province had conducted a total of 67 tests with 38 negative results. Officials said that all possible cases—including previous negative results—were being retested as additional assessments become available."

Officials reported that he had returned from Wuhan on his most recent voyage and he sought medical attention on January 26 following symptom onset and he has since been in self-isolation at home. A diagnostic test was conducted and it returned positive for the virus. The case was later confirmed and validated by the National Microbiology Laboratory on January 29. The Minister of Health and Provincial Health Officer for British Columbia Adrian Dix said that officials were in contact with a \"small number\" of people who may have interacted with the individual."

The patient, a male in his 50s who travelled between Wuhan and Guangzhou before returning to Toronto on January 22, contacted emergency services following rapid onset symptoms. The presumption of infection in the patient was made after a rapid test was done at Public Health Ontario's Toronto laboratory. Final testing conducted at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg, Manitoba validated the presumptive confirmation on January 27. Authorities said that the patient was experiencing respiratory problems but was in stable condition. His condition later improved and he was released from hospital on January 31."
